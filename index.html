          <p>I am an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">School of EECS</a> of <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University</a> in China. I major in computer science and technology.
            <!-- During my undergraduate study, I was fortunate to work with <a href="http://vis.pku.edu.cn/yuanxiaoru/index_en.html" target="_blank">Prof. Xiaoru Yuan</a> at <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn" target="_blank">Peking University</a> on visual analytics, <a href="http://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/" target="_blank">Prof. Chaoli Wang</a> at <a href="" target="_blank">University of Notre Dame</a> on developing educational visualization tool, and with <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/" target="_blank">Prof. Nicolas Christin</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> on mining massive amount of cryptocurrency trading data. -->
          </p>
          <p>I am broadly interested in researches that have practical contribution and give practical sense. For example, in 2021 I had two summer researches (mentioned above). One is developing TreeVisual, an educational tool for teaching and learning data visualization; the other is analyzing cryptocurrency trading data, which gives sense of how different kinds of people behave in the crypto market.</p>
          <p>More specifically, my interests include visualization, software development, accessibility, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>TreeVisual</strong> Advisor: <a href="http://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/" target="_blank">Professor Chaoli Wang</a>. Collaborator: Brendan O'Handley.
<br>TreeVisual is an educational software for teaching and learning tree visualization. It mainly uses JavaScript, d3.js, jQuery for frontend, and Ruby on Rails for backend. I implemented the quiz component, designed around 30 quiz questions, fixed several major bugs, and improved user experience.

<!-- <p><strong>Analyzing Binance Data</strong> Advisor: <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/" target="_blank">Professor Nicolas Christin</a>.
<br>In this project, we crawled massive amount of trade data from the Binance platform between Aug. 2020 to present. I looked for factors that indicates how a personal is doing, or how most people react to Bitcoin price fluctuations -- Do they go short when the price drops? Or do they go long and take the risk? -- and to outstanding accounts.</p> -->

<p><strong>Confronting Pandemic with Visual Insights: Collaborative Collection and Analysis of COVID-19
 Visualizations Worldwide</strong> Advisor: <a href="http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/info/1177/1377.htm" target="_blank">Professor Xiaoru Yuan</a>.
<br>In this project, we built a platform of collecting, annotating and analyzing visualizations via crowdsourcing. We then collected more than 5,000 visualizations related to COVID-19. From them, we extracted some principles and guidlines of visually conveying COVID-related information.
<br>I worked with peers on designing the platform (form layout, tooltips, etc.), and improved the backend by allowing users to upload multiple pictures; besides, I contributed to the dataset collection and annotation.

<!-- <p><strong>Coursework: Visualizing Sino-US relations</strong>
<br>In this coursework, we tried to visualize the Sino-US relations. We want to look at it from the perspective of news coverage: how many news (amount of attention) the media in one country has on the other, what topics do they care about of each other, etc.
<br>We crawled news related to Sino-US relations from 1900, and extracted keywords from their headlines and abstracts. We then built an interactive panel with the number of news, the ratio of coverage in six themes, and the wordcloud of keywords. I was in charge of crawling part of the data, and doing backend data analysis, such as extracting keywords using tf-idf and classifying themes.

<p><strong>Coursework: Chinese Poetry Generator</strong>
<br>In this coursework, I build a generator that writes Chinese poetry.
 <!-- It uses weighted cross-entropy as loss function, and the weight of each word is its tf-idf value in the dataset. The result is interesting: our model generates poems that really have the sense of poetry but have little meaning. We also find that the cross-entropy loss may not work well in creative tasks like this. -->

<br> In the MakeUC 2021 hackathon, we built a game in retro style using Python and Pygame. I was responsible for virtually all coding parts. This game is set in the world of the tv series "Squid Game". The player controls a stuff at a school and need to stop students not wearing masks from entering the campus. This game was award the Wolfram Award, top 15 out of the 100 submitted projects.</p>

<br> The MLH Fellowship Prep Program is a 3-week intense online program for programmers around the world (especially from underrepresented groups) to experience collaborating, experimenting new technologies, and building projects through a short hackathon sprint. In this Nov. prep program, I used Ruby and Jekyll to build a team website, and used React to build a weather prediction website with a trip planner.
